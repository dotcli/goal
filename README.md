# goal
.CLI is a project that explores creativity and aesthetics via coding.

To put into executable terms, .CLI creates software modules that can be composed together easily for visual and audio aesthetic.

## reason

The creation of .CLI is an experiment with abstracting the work away from the creator. As the creator grows and changes, their work interest and aesthetic will change too, drastically changing the output. This results in three scenarios:

1. The audience changes with the creator.
2. The audience stops following the creator.
3. The creator's growth gets slowed down by the need of maintaining past identity.

Therefore, projects with defined constraints are created to separate the creator and the creations, allowing the audience to stay true to their interest, and the creator to not get bogged down by past works.

## outputs

.CLI outputs:

- Visual & Audio explorative experiments
- Software modules & algorithms for creating visual & audio
- Collections of these software modules, categorized by aesthetic
- Other helpful tools developed along this journey
